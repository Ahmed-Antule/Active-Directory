# Active-Directory

ðŸ”¹ What is Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks.

It helps organizations manage users, computers, groups, printers, and other resources in a centralized and secure way.

First released with Windows 2000 Server, AD is now a core part of Windows Server environments.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

1. Centralized Management

Manage all users, computers, and policies from a single console.



2. Authentication & Authorization

Uses Kerberos and LDAP for secure login.

Ensures only authorized users can access resources.



3. Group Policy

Admins can control user desktops, applications, and security settings across the network.



4. Scalability

Supports small organizations and very large enterprises with millions of objects.


ðŸ”¹ Active Directory Components

1. Domain â€“ A logical group of objects (users, computers, etc.).


2. Tree â€“ A collection of domains that share a common namespace.


3. Forest â€“ The top-level container that holds multiple trees.


4. Organizational Units (OUs) â€“ Subdivisions inside a domain to organize users, groups, and devices.


5. Domain Controllers (DCs) â€“ Servers that store and manage the AD database, handling logins and security.

   
ðŸ”¹ Active Directory Services

AD DS (Domain Services) â€“ Core service that stores directory information.

AD FS (Federation Services) â€“ Provides single sign-on (SSO) across different systems.

AD CS (Certificate Services) â€“ Manages digital certificates.

AD LDS (Lightweight Directory Services) â€“ Directory services for applications without full AD.

AD RMS (Rights Management Services) â€“ Protects digital information from unauthorized use.


ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Active Directory

âœ… Centralized security management
âœ… Single sign-on (one password for multiple services)
âœ… Easy to enforce policies via Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
âœ… Scales well for enterprises
âœ… Enhances security with authentication & authorization

ðŸ‘‰ Summary:
Active Directory is the backbone of Windows enterprise networks, allowing admins to securely manage users, computers, and resources in a centralized way.


### Step - 1
i. Click on "Manage," then select "Add Roles and Features."

ii. Go to "Server Roles," then select and install "Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)."

iii. Go to the "Confirmation" section and click "Install."

iv. Once the installation is complete, click on "Promote this server to a domain controller."

Why Click on "Promote This Server to a Domain Controller" in Active Directory Setup?
After installing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on Windows Server 2019, the server needs to function as a Domain Controller (DC). Clicking "Promote This Server to a Domain Controller" is necessary because:

âœ… Activates Directory Services â€“ It enables the Active Directory database, allowing user authentication, group management, and security policies.
âœ… Creates or Joins a Domain â€“ It lets you either create a new domain (e.g., mycompany.local) or add the server to an existing domain.
âœ… Manages Authentication & Security â€“ The Domain Controller is responsible for verifying user logins, managing group policies, and securing access.
âœ… Enables Group Policies (GPOs) â€“ Once promoted, you can enforce security settings, software deployment, and administrative controls across the network.

Without promoting the server to a Domain Controller, the installed Active Directory services won't be functional, and the server will not manage users, groups, or policies effectively. ðŸš€

v. Click on "Add a New Forest" and enter the root domain name with the .local extension.

vi. In the Domain Controller configuration, set and confirm the password for the domain.

vii. Click "Next" until you reach the prerequisites check, then click "Install."

The VM will restart, and once it boots up, you will see that your domain has been successfully created.<br>
After logging in, you can view the installed components and configured settings within the Active Directory environment.

### Step - 2
i. Open "Active Directory Users and Computers" (ADUC).<br> <br>

ii. Right-click on your domain and select "New" > "Organizational Unit" to create a new OU.

What is an Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory? An Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory (AD) is a logical container used to organize and manage users, groups, computers, and other objects within a domain. It helps in structuring the directory to apply group policies and delegate administrative tasks efficiently

Example of OU Structure: ðŸ“‚ Company.local (Root Domain) â”œâ”€â”€ HR (OU) â†’ Users & Computers for HR â”œâ”€â”€ IT (OU) â†’ Users & Computers for IT Team â”œâ”€â”€ Finance (OU) â†’ Users & Computers for Finance

By using Organizational Units, businesses can structure their Active Directory efficiently, making it easier to manage users, devices, and policies. ðŸš€

ii. I have created an Organizational Unit (OU) named Company, which contains multiple sub-OUs for Users, Groups, Computers, and Servers.

Enter the password and select the checkbox below as per the company's policy.
